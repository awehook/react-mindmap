# DebugPlugin
    
The `debug-plugin` is introduced in the latest version of blink-mind. However, this repo is based on [v0.0.20-beta.6](https://github.com/awehook/blink-mind/tree/v0.0.20-beta.6). Therefore here is `StandardDebugPlugin`, which is adapted from [debug-plugin.tsx](https://github.com/awehook/blink-mind/blob/ae83ddeafa50c55fd6f24b98a3a2fc76a5e81ba7/packages/plugins/src/debug/debug-plugin.tsx).
